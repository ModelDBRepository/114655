Weiler N, Wood L, Yu J, Solla SA, Shepherd GM (2008) Top-down laminar 
organization of the excitatory network in motor cortex.
Nat Neurosci 11:360-6

Abstract:
---------
Cortical layering is a hallmark of the mammalian neocortex and a
major determinant of local synaptic circuit organization in sensory
systems. In motor cortex, the laminar organization of cortical
circuits has not been resolved, although their input-output
operations are crucial for motor control. Here, we developed a 
general approach for estimating layer-specific connectivity in
cortical circuits and applied it to mouse motor cortex. From these
data we computed a laminar presynaptic --> postsynaptic connectivity
matrix, W(post,pre), revealing a complement of stereotypic pathways
dominated by layer 2 outflow to deeper layers. Network modeling
predicted, and experiments with disinhibited slices confirmed, that
stimuli targeting upper, but not lower, cortical layers effectively
evoked network-wide events. Thus, in motor cortex, descending
excitation from a preamplifier-like network of upper-layer neurons
drives output neurons in lower layers. Our analysis provides a
quantitative wiring-diagram framework for further investigation of
the excitatory networks mediating cortical mechanisms of motor 
control.

Documentation for laminarWsimulation.m script:
----------------------------------------------

Simulates the flow of activity within and across laminar levels in the
local pyramidal neuron network, based on a connectivity matrix (W) 
measured by laser scanning photostimulation.

The simulation is a simple neural network simulation:

p(n) ----> c * W ----> p(n+1)

where p(n=0) is an input vector ('inputvector') representing a laminar 
profile of activity, c is a global scaling constant ('gain'), W is a 
measured connectivity matrix, and p(n+1) is an output vector, which is 
fed back into the network as the input vector for the next iteration.
